<h3>Education Loan for Study Abroad</h3>
<p>
Education loan (also known as Student Loan) is a category of loans provided to students who
want to pursue a course or a degree in a foreign country. A student acts as the main borrower,
and the parent/spouse/sibling can act as the co-applicant. The loan covers the basic course fees
and also some related expenses like accommodation, exam fees, etc.

Student loans are mainly categorized in two parts:-
Secured Loans: These are the one in which the lender provides loan against any collateral (land,
property or fixed deposits). The ROI charged imposed is around 8-10% p.a..
Unsecured: These are the ones that are provided without any security/guarantee. These are
offered based on the credential value of the borrower. In this, commercial banks provide only up
to ₹7 lakhs, whereas NBFCs (non-banking financial companies) offer up to ₹65 lakhs. The rate
of interest charged is around 11-15%.</p>


<h3>Expenses Covered in Education Loan</h3>
<p>The loan amount will cover all these areas:-</p>
<ul>


<li> Tuition fees</li>
<li>Hostel fees</li>
<li> Travel expenses passage money when travelling via sea</li>
<li> Insurance premium</li>
<li> Cost of books/equipment/instruments/uniform</li>
<li> Exam giving charges/lab usage expenses/library fees</li>

</ul>


<h3>Features &amp; Benefits of Educational/Student Loan</h3>

<ul>



<li> Loan up to Rs.1 crore available.</li>

<li> Loan repayment period is up to 15 years.</li>
<li> Children of bank workers have the benefit of good interest rates at many banks.</li>
<li>Some specific banks give preferable interest rates to female scholars.</li>
<li> Have the benefit of a moratorium period (in this the lender allows the student to take
sufficient time to segregate their financial affairs and arrange for loan repayment
accordingly) of up to 1 year after course completion. Banks also charge some interest for
this period, which is later added to the principal amount.
<li> Get tax benefits up to 8 years on the paid interest.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Tax Benefits on Education Loan</h3>

<p>
As per the law, under the section 80E of Income Tax Act 1961, the ROI on the education loan
can be deducted. This offer is only given to those individuals who want to pursue higher
education. This reduction in the interest amount is available for both academic and vocational
courses/programs (including all field of study).</p>
<p>One has to keep in mind that this reduction in tax is only provided on the interest part of the
EMI, and not on the principle amount. Although, the person can claim this benefit as many times
as he/she wish for. The person will require a certificate from their bank/institution that will
divide the principle and interest part of the EMIs to gain this benefit.
This advantage is provided for 8 years starting from the day of repayment or until the ROI is paid
(whatever comes first).</p>
